# Java Collections Framework - Exercises
A collection is an object that represents a group of objects. A **collections framework** is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.

3. Write a program to check if an array is empty or not (return true / false)
    
### HashSet
1. Write a program to change an HashSet into an Array
2. Write a program to compare two sets
3. Write a program to compare two sets and return the elements that they share
    
### HashMap
1. Write a program that adds a bunch of entries without multiple collection.add() methods
2. Write a program that finds out if a key-value entry is empty in its value or not
3. Write a program that prints all keys (not values) of a map
4. Write a program that prints all key-values of a map

### Any

```sh
